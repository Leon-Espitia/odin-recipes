            This is an authentic <strong>Swedish pancake recipe</strong> that was taught to me by my mother, who was born in Sweden. <em>Kids will love it</em> for sure and never will any leftovers. To serve, you can spoon melted butter over pancakes and sprinkle with sugar, or serve with <strong><em>blackberry jam</em></strong>.
